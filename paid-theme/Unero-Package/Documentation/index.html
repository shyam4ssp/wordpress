Install WordPress
-----------------

To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress already installed. You should ALWAYS be running the latest version of WordPress anyway, because otherwise you put your whole site at risk for potential threats. Never use an outdated version of WordPress.

 If you need help installing WordPress, follow the instructions in [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). Below are all the useful links for WordPress information.

- [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) – General info about WordPress and how to install on your server.
- [First Steps With WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress) – General info about multiple topics about WordPress.
- [FAQ New To WordPress](http://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_New_To_WordPress) – The most popular FAQ’s regarding WordPress.

Recommended PHP Configuration Limits
------------------------------------
Many issues that you may run into such as; white screen, demo content fails when importing, empty page content and other similar issues are all related to low PHP configuration limits. The solution is to increase the PHP limits. You can do this on your own, or contact your web host and ask them to increase those limits to a minimum as follows:

- max_execution_time: 180
- memory_limit: 128M
- post_max_size: 32M
- upload_max_filesize: 32M


Licensing Plugins
-----------------
The theme included the licensing plugin: Visual Composer, we purchased it from codecanyone.net and included it for free in the theme package without any issues. However, if you want automatic updates and support from the plugin developer, you need to purchase it separately (this is 100% optional). Because we are not allowed to include the license key for it, so you do NOT have a purchase code for that plugin and you can’t enter anything in this field. If there is any update, we are accountable for updating the theme with the newest version of  this plugin.


Files included in the package
-----------------------------

Below is a full list of everything that is included when you download the main files, along with a brief description of each item.

- `unero.zip`: main theme file that need to be uploaded to host to install Unero theme.
- `unero-child.zip`: basic child theme of Unero theme. It is created for people who want to customize code of the Unero theme.
- `Demo Data`: this folder contains demo data that exported our demo.
	- `widgets.wie`: this file contains all widgets which are exported from our demo.
	- `demo-content.xml`: this file contains all sample content which will help you to have a first look of how we use Unero theme.
	- `customizer.dat`: theme option backup file.

- `Documentation`: documentation folder that contains documentation files.

> documentation…etc which displays the “The package could not be

In short, with a theme that supports Post Formats, a blogger can change how each post looks by choosing a Post Format from a radio-button list.

Unero theme supports the following post formats:

- `gallery` - A gallery of images, which will be displayed in a responsive image slider, powered by Flexslider.
- `video` - A single video, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed above post title.
- `audio` - An audio file, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed using a powerful HTML5 audio player provided by Wordpress as default player.

Using post format in Unero lets you differentiate post from each other and make the blog page / single page looks more beautiful.



When you edit a post, select a format you want to apply to that post on the **Format** meta box on the right:

![formats](images/post-format-box.png)

When you choose a format, a corresponding meta box will appear **below** the content editor, here's the list of them:

![formats](images/post-formats.png)

All you need to do is just enter **all** information in the fields in these meta boxes. This information will be used to decorate the post.

Child Theme
===========

Unero is fully child theme compatible. We have attached a basic child theme to the download package which contains the minimum of required files. If you are planing any code customizations we highly recommend to do this inside the child theme! Learn more about child themes [here](http://codex.wordpresss.org/Child_Themes)
